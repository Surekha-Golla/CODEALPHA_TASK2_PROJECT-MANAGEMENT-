The code is a simple HTML structure for a Project Management Tool.

It includes a form to input tasks and a list to display them.

The <head> section links a CSS file (styles.css) for styling and a JS file (script.js) for functionality.

The <body> contains a container with a heading, an input field, a submit button, and an empty task list.

The form (<form id="taskForm">) allows users to add tasks dynamically.

The <ul id="taskList"> will display the tasks added by the user.

The tool is designed to be responsive using the viewport meta tag.

JavaScript will handle form submission and update the task list.

This is a basic starting point and can be expanded with features like task deletion or local storage.

Itâ€™s a minimalist, functional prototype for managing tasks in a web app.
